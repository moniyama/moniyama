### About me

I started at this web-developer world :earth_americas: in 2019, when I first console-logged `Hello world` in `Javascript`. Althought it wasn't my primary contact with computer languages, it was the first time I've seriously thought about a career-change into this area.

After attending an intensive six-month bootcamp at [@laboratoria](https://github.com/Laboratoria), I finally did it. Nowadays I'm a JS coach at this same instituition, learning constantly about soft and hard-skills with my team, co-workers and students since the beggining of ~~covid-pandemic calamity~~ March, 2020.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and adventuring myself in `algorithms and data structures`, `Google Assistant and Cloud functions`.

:video_game:
I'm into adventure or coop-games as Legend of Zelda, PokÃ©mon, Overcooked etc.
